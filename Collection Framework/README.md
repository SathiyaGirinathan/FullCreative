Arrays Vs Collections


Arrays:
------
1)	Fixed in size
2)	With respect to memory arrays are not recommended to use
3)	With respect to performance Arrays are recommended to use
4)	Can hold both primitive and Objects
5)	Arrays concept is not implemented based on some standard data structure. Hence readymade method support is not available in arrays

Collections:
------------
1)	Growable in nature
2)	With respect to memory collections are recommended to use
3)	With respect to performance Collections are not recommended to Use
4)	Can hold only Objects
5)	Collection classes are implemented based on some standard data structure. Hence readymade method support is available in arrays.

Collection vs Collections:

Collection (I):
----------
1) Collection is a Interface which belongs to java.util package.
2) Collection can be used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity
3) Collection is the root interface from which almost all DS are derived, commonly known as collection framework

Collections (C):
-----
1) Collections is a utility class which belongs to java.util.package.
2) Collections define several utility methods like sorting searching for collection objects
3) Collections class contain many static methods with which DS manipulation becomes easier

Arrays Vs Collections


Arrays:
------
1)	Fixed in size
2)	With respect to memory arrays are not recommended to use
3)	With respect to performance Arrays are recommended to use
4)	Can hold both primitive and Objects
5)	Arrays concept is not implemented based on some standard data structure. Hence readymade method support is not available in arrays

Collections:
------------
1)	Growable in nature
2)	With respect to memory collections are recommended to use
3)	With respect to performance Collections are not recommended to Use
4)	Can hold only Objects
5)	Collection classes are implemented based on some standard data structure. Hence readymade method support is available in arrays.
